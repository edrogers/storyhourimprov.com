Join us for "Story Time: The Improv Musical," a delightful event designed for families with children ages 8 and under! Every performance is centered on a different children's book. We invite you to read the book with your little one beforehand. During the show, we’ll gather creative input from our young readers and transform their ideas into an on-the-spot musical performance.

Expect a fun, funny, engaging, and delightfully silly experience that the whole family will love. Featuring an experienced and talented Madison-based cast, this unique event is a celebration of storytelling, creativity, and the magic of improvisation. Doors open at 9:40am, and street parking is the only option, so please budget a bit of extra time. Don’t miss out on this interactive adventure in musical theater!
