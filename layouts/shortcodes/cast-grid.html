            <h3 class="mt-3">Sarah Rogers</h3>
            <p>Sarah grew up in Central Illinois, where she spent a lot of time worrying about tornadoes and thunderstorms. These days, she's more focused on wellness, good books, and trying to convince her kids to pick up their own socks (a project that appears to have no clear end date). One of her favorite books as a kid was <i>Each Peach Pear Plum</i>.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Doug Reed</h3>
            <p>Doug grew up in Richmond, Virginia. He didn't pay much attention in school. The best job he ever had was running the roller coaster at King's Dominion amusement park. One of his favorite books was <i>Where The Wild Things Are</i>.

            <h3 class="mt-3">Andrew Rohn</h3>
            <p>Andrew grew up making music and never stopped. He believes in the power of a strong melody and the way music brings people together. He's played in rock bands, written musicals, and currently brings the groove with Madison's own V05. He loves being in the garden and hanging out with his dogs, Beasley and Lola.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Kelly Maxwell</h3>
            <p>Kelly grew up in Muscatine, Iowa. She spent a lot of time making up songs, telling stories, and pretending to be other people. She still does. Kelly wrote a whole musical once — <i>Held: A Musical Fantasy</i> — and she's pretty proud of that. She also sings in bands, draws things, and believes that improv is a kind of magic.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Sheila Robertson</h3>
            <p>Sheila has been making things up for a living since the early '90s—on stage, in sales, and in life. She fell in love with improv as a teenager and never looked back. She believes in the power of saying “Yes, and...,” the magic of quick connections, and the importance of a well-timed dance party. When she's not making people laugh, she's probably in the garden, turning big ideas into something real.</p>
